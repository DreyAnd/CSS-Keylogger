# Pure CSS keylogger

Made this as a form of practice I can save here, however I did implement some cool features such as maintaining better order of characters.

* Steps:
  1. Generate the keylogger with `generate-css-ordered.py` and your exfil server IP.
  2. Import it on your target
  3. Have `exfil.py` server running and waiting.
